## The Overview

Airbnb is a popular website that is disrupting the hospitality industry by giving people the power to rent out rooms in their homes and/or rent wherever they choose. In other words, Airbnb became the middleman, not hotels. With Airbnb, hosts can list their spaces and book unique accomodations. The prices are determined by the hosts and are often cheaper and much more convenient for many.

Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers from all over the world have chosen to use this site as an alternative source of income or a unique way of traveling. The company is successful because it helps make sharing one's space easy and safe. Personal profiles and listings are verified. A smart messaging system is also available so hosts and guests can communicate. It is such a successful platform that Holberton School has decided to create a project out of it!

Here, at Holberton School, our assignment is to clone AirBnb. This is one of five assignments and for this first assignment, our goal is to create the console with Python. The console is important for the overall success of the project because it allows us to create, destroy, show, save, and update our BaseModel, a framework that is inheritable by other classes, aka categories.
